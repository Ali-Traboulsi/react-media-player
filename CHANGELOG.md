## CHANGELOG
### 0.3.1
Fixes bad reference to main file in package.json

### 0.3.0
Added `vendor` prop to allow explicitly choosing which component to render for the player. Useful for cases where we can't determine what type of file is trying to be played.

### 0.2.0
Complete rewrite, better API, use of context in place of spreading props.
